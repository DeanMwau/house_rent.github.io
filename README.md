Project Title: House Rent 
Video Demo: https://youtu.be/B19i9vy9XAg

Project Description:
My House Rent website allows property owners to list apartments for rent, while tenants can browse available listings, view detailed information (such as descriptions, rent, and location), and leave reviews. The platform also enables tenants to enquire about apartments, rent properties, and update or manage their reviews. Property owners can manage their apartment listings, delete listings, view tenant reviews, and enquiries, and make edits to the apartment details. The platform ensures seamless interaction between property owners and potential tenants, fostering transparency and informed decision-making.

Project Explanation:
In completing this project, I relied on technologies such as Flask, SQLite, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2, and JavaScript. Flask was chosen as the web framework because of its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. It allows for quick development and easy integration with templating engines like Jinja2, ideal for this project. SQLite is lightweight and easy to set up, making it an excellent choice for this project in its initial stages. Its simplicity supports rapid prototyping while providing robust database functionality. Additionally, HTML was used to structure the website content, and CSS was used for styling and enhancing the user experience. These technologies ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design. Bootstrap provides pre-designed components and a responsive grid system, significantly speeding up the development process while ensuring a professional and mobile-friendly design. JavaScript helps enhance interactivity, such as enabling scrolling of photos in the case where owners upload multiple photos. 
One of the challenges I faced when completing this project included ensuring only logged-in users could perform certain actions, like leaving reviews or managing properties, which required careful session management. I also struggled to properly handle scenarios like displaying user-specific options (e.g., “Edit” or “Delete” buttons for a tenant’s review) and ensuring users see only what is relevant to them. In the future, I would like to add additional features such as filters for tenants to search properties based on price range or ratings. I would also like to implement a secure payment gateway to allow tenants to pay rent or deposits online. 
This project has different files that ensure it performs as designed. For example, it has the register.html, which allows users to register or sign up, and the login.html file which allows them to log in to manage properties or rent if they registered as tenants. The about.html provides users with essential information about the website, its purpose, and how it works, add_apartment.html allows owners to list their apartments, apartments_search.html displays available apartments based on the user's search query (location), while the apartments.html displays all available apartments. The edit_apartment.html allows owners details about apartments they have uploaded while the change_password.html allows all users to change their passwords. View_reviews.html, view_rent_requests.html, enquiries.html, and owner_dashboard.html allow owners to view reviews from tenants, rent requests, rental inquiries, and all the apartments they have uploaded to the platform respectfully. On the other hand, reviews.html, rented_apartment.html, and enquire_form.html allow tenants to review different apartments, view the apartments they have rented, and enquire or contact owners about an apartment respectfully. The explore.html allows users to explore all available apartments without having to log in while the index.html file serves as the homepage where user can search for apartments using location as the search query.  In conclusion, layout.html serves as the base template that defines the overall structure and shared elements across all pages of my application. It provides a consistent design framework, ensuring that every page of the website has a unified look and feel while reducing repetitive code.

Design Debates and Choices:
When building the House Rent website, certain design choices required careful consideration to ensure functionality, usability, and an appealing user experience. One of the debates was whether to store tenant and property owner information in the same table or separate them into two distinct tables. I created separate tables (tenants and property_owners) for better modularity, security, and scalability. I also deliberated whether to allow anonymous reviews or enforce login before posting reviews. I decided that users must log in to add a review, ensuring accountability and credibility, preventing spam or irrelevant reviews. In conclusion, I also deliberated whether to sanitize inputs at the client side, server side, or both. I chose to sanitize inputs on both client and server sides which ensures that malicious scripts are blocked at multiple levels, improving overall security.
